## Explanation
Part of my work focused on seeing how different plasma parameters changed as a function of the degree of symmetry-breaking in the magnetic field. The fortran files in /version3files are altered from the main version of sfincs to include an option to scale the non-quasisymmetric modes of $1/B^2$ by a symmetry breaking factor $\epsilon_{sb}$. For certain scripts to work, this functionality is required.

## Instructions
I left all of the files which I know needed to be altered in some way for the asymmetric mode scaling to work correctly. There may be a few extra files that are no different from the main version of sfincs (as of July 16, 2025), but I included all of them just to be sure. Overwriting the .f90 files from the main branch with these files should let you use the scripts in this repository.
