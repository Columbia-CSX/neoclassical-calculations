Collection of helper scripts for post-processing of SFINCS ouputs

This repository is maintained by Michael Campagna and was created as a part of the 2025 Plasma Physics REU at Columbia-- contact them at macampagna@wm.edu if you
have any questions.

## Dependencies
Aspects of these scripts depend on [simsopt](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt) and [sfincs](https://github.com/landreman/sfincs). Some changes have
been made to sfincs to make it compatible with this code #list of changes
