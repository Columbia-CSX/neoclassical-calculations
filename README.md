Collection of helper scripts for post-processing of SFINCS ouputs

This repository was created by Michael Campagna, Summer 2025. 

## Dependencies
Aspects of these scripts depend on [simsopt](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt), [sfincs](https://github.com/landreman/sfincs), and [stelloptPlusSfincs](https://github.com/leebr48/stelloptPlusSfincs). Some changes have been made to sfincs to make it compatible with this code #list of changes

## How to use

I don't think anyone else will use these, but I'll add some explanation to this section later just in case. Send me an email at macampagna@wm.edu if you have any questions :)
